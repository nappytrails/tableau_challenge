# Citi Bike Analysis for Sept 2021

## Most activity was in Lower and Midtown Manhattan.
The most popular stations to begin or end a trip were generally in more affluent and tourism-heavy areas of the city, namely Lower and Midtown Manhattan.

## Evening rush hours were the most popular ride times.
Thursday was the most popular day for rides followed by Wednesday and Saturday. The curves showing ride counts throughout the day are nearly identical during weekdays as is the case on weekends. During the week, the peak hours for rides are between 5 and 7 p.m., likely due to evening commutes, whereas during the weekend, peak hours are between 2 and 4 p.m. on Saturdays and 3 and 5 p.m. on Sundays.

## There is opportunity to expand ridership in lower income areas.
The bulk of the top 100 starting stations are areas of highest median income whereas the bulk of the bottom 100 starting stations are located in the lower median income areas. This is likely in part because the top 100 starting stations are in prime tourist areas.

Casual rides in the bottom 100 stations account for 55% of total ridership versus 42% of rides from the top 100 being casual riders. This could be because a membership is an extra monthly expense that is not feasible in lower income neighborhoods. However there is opportunity to increase profit per ride if ridership from the bottom stations since, presumably, casual rides offer higher profit per ride than member rides.

The average trip duration of the bottom 100 start stations is higher than the top 100 (26 minuts versus 17 minutes), but the median trip duration is the same (11 minutes) for both the bottom and top stations indicating that generally, trip durations are probably similar across both segments.
